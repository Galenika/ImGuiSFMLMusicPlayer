Place Music Files Here

MP3 will not work due to Patent issues. 

Please use: 

*.ogg

I've limited the program to only take .ogg files just to make the file checking easier (it would throw lots of errors and crash due other files like pngs)
You can easily code the program to accept the following files by removing the limitation to only .ogg and replacing it with some check to exclude the jpg/png art:

*.wav
*.flac
*.aiff
*.au
*.raw
*.paf
*.svx
*.nist
*.voc
*.ircam
*.w64
*.mat4
*.mat5
*.pvf
*.htk
*.sds
*.avr
*.sd2
*.caf
*.wve
*.mpc2k
*.rf64
