Place Music Files & Music Art Here

Track Art should have the exact same name as the track, current the only accepted formats are .jpg and .png

Please ensure Track Art is 512x512 Pixels. You can make it smaller but you will notice something similar to this: http://i.imgur.com/xIbJC2P.png.
Nothing stopping you from making it larger, but it will increase the sprite size as I haven't been able to find a way to limit sprite size or control texture/sprite size other than relative scaling.

MP3 will not work due to Patent issues. 

Please use: 

*.ogg

I've limited the program to only take .ogg files just to make the file checking easier (it would throw lots of errors and crash due other files like pngs)
You can easily code the program to accept the following files by removing the limitation to only .ogg and replacing it with some check to exclude the jpg/png art:

*.wav
*.flac
*.aiff
*.au
*.raw
*.paf
*.svx
*.nist
*.voc
*.ircam
*.w64
*.mat4
*.mat5
*.pvf
*.htk
*.sds
*.avr
*.sd2
*.caf
*.wve
*.mpc2k
*.rf64
