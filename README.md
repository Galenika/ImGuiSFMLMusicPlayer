# ImGui SFML Music Player
C++ Music Player using ImGui + SFML

Done as part of a code test & may continue afterwards for learning imgui & SFML.

Decided to make this open source since there wasn't any ImGui + SFML Music Player examples, thought I may as well.

This is the first time I've made anything open-source. I've only just started and thought I'd get it up on GitHub sooner than later! So at the moment its extremely early stages of development, I have a lot of things to do but I hope to have first release done for 13/06/17. (also sorry if I forget to edit this)

Early Development Issue Tracking: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c5FJh6jmOxvn2W8SCCa5x8n5d-v1SeSz_31nJoxhd5w/edit?usp=sharing
- To avoid an insane number of issues on GitHub (and that I've never used GitHub Issues before) the first stage of issue tracking (aka my To-Do list) can be found at the above Google Doc link.
- Once first release (13th or 14th) I will switch to GitHub Issues and leave the Google Doc
